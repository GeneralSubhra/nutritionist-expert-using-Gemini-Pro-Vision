The "Calories Advisor App" is an End to End project that harnesses the power of Google Gemini Pro Vision, to analyze and provide insights on nutrition from uploaded images of food items. The user can upload an image containing various food items, and the app utilizes the Generative AI model to generate a detailed response. The response includes a breakdown of the total calories, individual calories for each food item, and additional details such as whether the food is deemed healthy. The model also provides the percentage split of essential nutritional components like carbohydrates, fats, fibers, sugars, and other nutrients crucial for a balanced diet.

The app's frontend is designed with Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload images, visualize the uploaded image, and receive nutrition-related information with a single click. The underlying logic integrates the Google Generative AI model, configured with an API key, to process the image and generate informative content. This project is aimed at assisting nutritionists or individuals interested in understanding the nutritional composition of their meals visually. With a clear and user-friendly interface, the Calories Advisor App simplifies the process of obtaining valuable dietary insights from food images.
